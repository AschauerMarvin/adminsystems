# Adminsystems CMS
The branding-free CMS for Developers

Version 5 Development has started.

It will be a CMS to manage multiple frontends (and domains) within a single overview that customers can use. 
The documentation will be in the wiki soon.

Requirements:
* PHP 5.5.9+
* PHP-intl
* PHP-mbstring
* MySQL 5.1.10+ (or MariaDB)
* Apache with mod_rewrite (other servers should work too, but not tested yet)

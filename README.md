adminsystems
============

Adminsystems CMS, based on PHP

***I don't recommend using this software except for testing environments.***

This beta release should be useable and comes with and installer.

Simply give file permissions and run the installer (open the location you copyed adminsystems into in an web browser)

req php5, mysql
